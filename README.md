# Stateful widgets
In Flutter, widgets are like building blocks that you can use to create your app's user interface. There are two types of widgets in Flutter: stateful and stateless. Stateful widgets are ones that can change over time, while stateless widgets are ones that don't change.

Think of a stateful widget like a video game character. The character's appearance and behavior can change as you play the game. For example, if the character gets hit by an enemy, their health might decrease, and they might change their behavior to try to avoid getting hit again. Similarly, a stateful widget can change its appearance and behavior based on user interaction or other events that happen while the app is running.

A stateful widget has two parts: the widget itself and its state. The widget is the visual part that the user sees and interacts with, while the state is the data and behavior that can change over time. You can think of the widget like a person, and the state like their thoughts and emotions.

When you create a stateful widget in Flutter, you need to define its initial state. This is like giving the character in the video game their starting health and abilities. The initial state is set when the widget is first created and doesn't change until the widget is rebuilt.

Whenever the state of a stateful widget changes, Flutter rebuilds the widget to reflect the new state. This is like the character in the video game changing their behavior based on their new health and abilities.

To summarize, a stateful widget in Flutter is like a video game character that can change its appearance and behavior based on user interaction or other events that happen while the app is running. It has two parts: the widget itself and its state. When the state changes, Flutter rebuilds the widget to reflect the new state.
